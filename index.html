                    <h2>America's clock is ticking.</h2>
                    <p><i>What School Could Be</i> offers an inspiring vision of what our teachers and students can
                        accomplish if trusted with the right challenge:  helping our students develop the skillsets and mindsets that will empower them to thrive in a world of dizzying technological change.</p>
                    <p>During the 2016 school year, innovation expert Ted Dintersmith took an unprecedented trip across America.  He visited all fifty states, with the goal of raising awareness about the urgent need to reimagine education to prepare students for a world marked by innovation.  A bit to his surprise, he met teachers all across the country doing extraordinary things in ordinary settings, creating innovative classrooms where children learn deeply and joyously as they gain purpose, agency, essential skillsets and mindsets, and deep knowledge. In aggregage, the insights of these teachers offer a vision of what school could be, and a model for how to help all schools achieve it.</p>
                    <p>America's clock is ticking. Our archaic model of education trains our kids for a world that no longer exists.  Accelerating advances in technology are eliminating millions of jobs. Absent profound change, millions of futures are at risk, as is our democracy.  But America’s innovative educators gives us reasons for hope. We need to listen to them, and <strong><i>What School Could Be</i></strong> will give you a running start.</p>

                            <p>What School Could Be shares thought-provoking stories about critical, positive changes happening in schools across the country. As Ted Dintersmith shows, and as I have seen in New Hampshire, empowering teachers in existing public schools allows them to arm students with the tools they need to succeed. These examples can help all policymakers focus on what actually works as we move this important discussion forward.</p>
